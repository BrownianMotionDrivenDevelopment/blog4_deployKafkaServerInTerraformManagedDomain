# Deploy Kafka Server In A Terraform Managed Domain

This is the example code for the [Deploy Kafka Server In A Terraform Managed Domain blog](https://andyboyle.io/2017/04/05/deploy-kafka-server-in-a-terraform-managed-subdomain/)

It wraps up the prevous 3 articles so after this we have configured a Kafka Server ( standalone - not recommended other than dev obviously ) and deployed it with an assigned DNS name in our managed subzone.
For more details the blog link and the previous ones.
